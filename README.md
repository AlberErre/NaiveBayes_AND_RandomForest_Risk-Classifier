# NaiveBayes_risk
Machine Learning Classifiers (Naive Bayes and Random forest) to evaluate risk in credit cards
Database source: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/default+of+credit+card+clients#

# Code:
Matlab - Final code: NaiveBayes_risk/FINAL_Credit_risk_NaiveBayes_RandomForest.m
https://github.com/AlberErre/NaiveBayes_risk/blob/master/FINAL_Credit_risk_NaiveBayes_RandomForest.m

# Steps taken:
1) Obtaining data (credit cards, UCI Machine Learning Database)

2) Cleaning and preprocessing data (wrangling), high correlations found in some variables

3) Studying matlab documentation and development process

4) Developing Naive Bayes and Random Forest algorithms

5) Improving parameters and comparing models (density functions, priors, number of random forest.. etc)

6) Adding a cost matrix to solve unbalanced data problem and increase results

7) Comparing resuls and writing down conclusions
